    "Mathematical morphology provides tools to \"fix\" thresholded images. Mathematical morphology is a discipline based on set theory that enables manipulation and analysis of geometric structures. Mathematical morphology deals with sets of pixels above or below the threshold value. **Erosion, dilation, opening or closing** are some mathematical morphology operations. Similar to our discussion of filters, in morphological operations the value of each pixel (on/off) is determined based on the status (on/off) of a set of neighbours. The set of neighbours that affect the value of any given pixel is determined by a structuring element, a \"mask\" that is overlaid on each pixel of the original image. Pixels that are \"on\" in the structuring element are taken into account in the calculation of the new pixel value. Manipulating the size and shape of the structuring element can therefore have dramatic consequences on the results of morphological operations.  \n",

    "**Opening and closing**, specifically, can be useful to process binary images: opening separates fused objects, and closing fills holes in objects. Opening and closing are implemented in the methods **skimage.morphology.binary_opening and skimage.morphology.binary_closing**, respectively. \n",
